Project fully done in:

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript**

## Project goal:
It shows how it can be easy to code appealing animations with native JS and SVGs, especially animating the main line of timeline, items gradually appearing, changing the appearance of the timeline items depending on screen width but in JS, as well as scroll to top button. If you would like to use my code snippets you are welcome. You have the comments above each code snippets in main.js file, and therefore you can easily choose the snippet that you need.
